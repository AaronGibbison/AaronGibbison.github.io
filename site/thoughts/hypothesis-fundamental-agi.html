Modern AI largely (but not exclusively) uses a mixture of large data sets and Deep Neural Networks to achieve a highly sophisticated AI with the assistance of Machine Learning technics. There has been developments of how DNNs in regards to ML methods and Neutral Net nodes. These are not the only methods, but have a substantial influence in the current state of AI, e.g. part of AlphaGo&apos;s learning was due to the use of adversarial networks.</p></div><div><h2 id="emergent-behaviour">Emergent Behaviour</h2><p>Behaviour for a computer programme is often explicitly described. Emergent behaviour is the practice of writing a series of rules in which a appears. The advantage of emergent behaviour is that it can allow for complex systems with a simple set of constructs.</p><p>A simple example of emergent behaviour is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">Boids</a>, which imitates a flock of birds without being explicit. The same set of rules can be used to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw">simulate a fish colony</a>. A simple extension to the Boids&apos; separation rule can allow them to scatter when a predator approaches, or avoid obstacles.</p><p>Why use emergent behaviour for Artificial Intelligence? Instead of trying to conform an AI to a desired outcome (such as GPT3 or AlphaGo), Emergent behaviour will hopefully allow for a more complex AI to arise. The principals proposed here will allow for such an AI to:<ol><li>Learn rapidly</li><li>Solve complex problems</li><li>Work with a low volume of data</li><li>Evolve when encountering unknown problems</li></ol></p></div><div><h2>Issues with Emergent Behaviour</h2><p>Before going into the principals an Emergent AI should to be based upon, considerations for why it may not work, or the complexities involved in each subsections. By understanding these failure points, it will give a path to correct these issues, resulting in an AGI.</p><h3>General Problems</h3><p>Firstly, what will the Emergent AI looks like? The modal used is important, otherwise difficulties will appear in developing the rules which will allow for Emergent behaviour. Neural Networks could be a good idea since they are meant to be based on real life. An issue that could occur using NNs, modifying the dynamics may require relearning everything again, severely hampering the AIs ability to evolve.</p><h3>Temporal</h3><p></p><h3>Abstraction</h3><p></p><h3>Acceptable Failure</h3><p></p><h3>Growth (Self Modification)</h3><p>As mentioned in the general problem section, construction is important for relearning. Prevent uncontrolled growth is equally important, due to the unnecessary increase in resource consumption (energy and space). While it may not seem like a problem, it would cripple training as only some computers can even train such an AI, alongside all the additional parameters which increase training time, such as for a Neural Network by n<sup>2</sup>.</p></div><div><h2>Temporal</h2><div></div></div><div><h2>Abstraction</h2><div></div></div><div><h2>Acceptable Failure</h2><div></div></div><div><h2>Growth (Self Modification)</h2><div></div></div><div><h2>Notes</h2><ol><li id="footnote-1">Artificial intelligence in this situation refers to &apos;weak&apos; AI.
