    <main><h1>~ Failure as a Software Engineer</h1><p>Created: 2022-07-25</p><p>Updated: 2022-08-05</p><h2>Miss Management 2 - June 2022</h2><p>Tl;dr self Improvement: Better information gathering. Communicate more. Better plan time.</p><p>Deciding on the architecture took an extensive amount of time - if a meeting with UX was had instead, their requirements could have been obtained earlier in the process. This would mean, when analysing different technologies / systems, we could pick one which would better fit all the criteria. A delay of at least 2 weeks was caused by this - enough to setup the testing framework to provide confidence that was severely lacking.</p><p>Gathering requirements from external stakeholder did not go well. In part, it was an internal problem - however, a greater level of scrutinisation should have occurred. By getting out a thoroughly detailed requirement would have reduced the initial bug rate. When slowly finding out requirements of the project, I did not share it well with the other engineers.</p><p>Lastly, there were several times that my time may have been spent better. A week was spent creating detailed tests for validation - this could have been left to QA to gather examples that should been tested. Then a set up which can easily use new / different data would have made it easy for QA to add data to check. Similarly, I did not need to do work setting up the infrastructure, and asked production engineering to do the work. Downside of taking such a path is the lack of learning - not understanding Terraform or the architecture itself.</p><h2>Poor Training - H2 2021</h2><p>Tl;dr self Improvement: Better understand how Junior works, and use their preferred method.</p><p><b>Note: Maybe too hard on self, with too high of expectations on the Junior?</b></p><p>Having a Junior Developer on the team, it was my duty to train the Junior into becoming a mid level engineer. Giving my subpar communication skills, lack of ability in mentorship and desire to do complex tasks. Development of the Junior developer did not go so well. By a year in, they are not fully independent, still requiring assistance in tasks I would think of as easily doable by a mid level engineer.</p><p>When mentoring in the future, I should better understand how the personal thinks. By understanding their thought process when dealing with problems, I can better mentor them by providing advice or tasks that suit their methodology. While gruelling, maybe it is better to let Juniors deal with debugging alone? The ability to debug independently is extensively useful, and enables a better understand of how systems work.</p><h2>Miss Management - June 2019</h2><p>Tl;dr self Improvement: Ensure in the early stage of work, that the correct approach is taken.</p><p>In my second official project (C# .Net), I got the privilege to coordinate a major sub project for the client. A senior developer, to whom I sat next to, was my mentor / adviser to the project. The sub project lasted 3 months, with each month being a separate stage of the sub project. The team for the complete project, at its largest, was 11 personal. However, the subproject had 3 or 4 personal at any one time. The project had a monthly, release cycle.</p><p>The first two months went fine. I believe there were minor issue running up to the deadline, but everything was released on time, and in working order. On the last month of sub project, allocating tasks to team members. I allocated an important page to a given team member - to which this page was vital. Work allocation in itself should not be an issue - since in theory, senior members should be able to complete their workload/ Then they can assist other members, bringing the project up to speed (maybe a couple days behind).</p><p>To my vague memory, there were significant issues with the page. This could have been easily resolved by checking in early to see how it was going, allowing for rapid amendments, impacting completion time. Instead, the work had to largely be redone delaying not only the page, but the entire project by a week. This resulted in missing our standard release cycle, causing immense displeasure. I believe this caused strain within the business relationship, and reworked the business agreement.</p><p>Another issue I noticed, was a potential performance hit. Given a sufficiently large dataset, the page load time would be noticeably significant. Instead of fixing it when known, it was instead delayed until after the release, in which the client complained. While not awful, it demonstrated a lack of care about the system. Negative 1 point.</p><h2>Overly Enthusiastic - December 2018</h2><p>Tl;dr self Improvement: Be more focused on what work is being done. Do one task, and do it well.</p><p>Was my first official project (JS / TS) at Softwire - to develop an API interface. I was not on holiday over christmas while the other 2 members of the team were. One of the members moved projects in early January, leaving me and another personal there after.</p><p>Given I was alone for ~1.5 weeks over Christmas to do the work - I vaguely implemented a breadth of the apis. My code quality was poor at the time, and none of the tasks were 100% completed. This meant the my colleague had to deal with my shoody code, while finishing implementing the APIs. I eventually bounced back and fourth between two API, until their implementations was complete.</p><p>For me at the time, this felt fine. However, it was terrible for the colleague I worked with, and likely extended the length of the project. The code quality was okay - most because of my colleague cleaning up after me along the way. I do wonder if the client (who were technical) had salt in their mouth as they would have an expectation of what the quality should be like - at least future projects made clients happy (but not the next one).</p><p>It wasn&apos;t all bad. There were edge cases that I noticed in regards to race conditions, and have extensive discussions in order to resolve. Also added logs in areas where I believed was a high likelihood of failure. This came in useful when testing of the APIs failed, and was able to implement a fix within ~20 minutes, due to logs being available.</p></main><nav><a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Homepage</a><a class="nav-link" href="ideas.html">Ideas</a><a class="nav-link" href="hypothesis-fundamental-agi.html">~ Hypothesis for the fundamentals of an Artificial General Intelligence</a><a class="nav-link" href="failure-engineer.html">~ Failure as a Software Engineer</a><a class="nav-link" href="addition-prime-factors.html">~ Addition and Prime Factors</a><a class="nav-link" href="career-progression.html">~ Career Progression</a><a class="nav-link" href="nurbs.html">~ Nurbs</a><a class="nav-link" href="mental-health.html">~ Problems with Mental Health Awareness</a><a class="nav-link" href="programming-axioms.html">~ Axioms for Good Code</a></nav>
