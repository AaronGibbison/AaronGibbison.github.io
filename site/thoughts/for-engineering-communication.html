It is hard to keep things simple. - Richard Branson</p><br /><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Engineers need to modify existing systems frequently. If a system can be modified with ease, then improvements can be made rapids, while also given Engineers the freedom to pursue other goals. Maintainability becomes the primary focus of the majority of Engineers to achieve this goal, often to the detriment of other &quot;non-function&quot; (technical) requirements.</p><p>However, maintainability is rarely quantitatively determined, instead qualitatively determined. If Engineers can quantitatively define maintainability, then decisions can be made to empirically improve maintainability. Often, a metric used is how long is takes new features to be developed. But this metric is problematic since it cannot be compared to the previous implementation, while taking months to get significant data.</p><h2>Quantifying Maintainability</h2><p>Ensuring reliability in quantifying main maintainability will</p><h2>Simplicity</h2><p>Software simplicity should be the primary focus of software design. The importance of simplicity cannot be understated, achieving non-functional (technical) benefits with far less effort. E.g. A simpler system is easier to understand, and thus modify, implementing new features. There are fewer scenarios which makes testing easier, plus the reduced surface area makes defects less likely. Building simple systems</p><p>To design a simple engineering infrastructure, there are multiple layer to consider: code, application, domain, business. All stages needs to be considered creating the overall business architecture, even if not formally expressed every time. Business and domain are frequently decided before the work has started, brown-field work will follow conventions of the existing application, leaving the code for most Engineers. Senior Engineers may venture into deciding the architecture at the application, but only the most Senior Engineers (often Principal / Staff) or Engineering Management will make domain level decision.</p></main><nav><a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Homepage</a><a class="nav-link" href="ideas.html">Ideas</a><a class="nav-link" href="hypothesis-fundamental-agi.html">~ Hypothesis for the fundamentals of an Artificial General Intelligence</a><a class="nav-link" href="failure-engineer.html">~ Failure as a Software Engineer</a><a class="nav-link" href="addition-prime-factors.html">~ Addition and Prime Factors</a><a class="nav-link" href="career-progression.html">~ Career Progression</a><a class="nav-link" href="nurbs.html">~ Nurbs</a><a class="nav-link" href="mental-health.html">~ Problems with Mental Health Awareness</a><a class="nav-link" href="programming-axioms.html">~ Axioms for Good Code</a><a class="nav-link" href="for-engineering-communication.html">~ For Effective Engineering</a></nav></div>
